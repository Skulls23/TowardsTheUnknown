# TowardsTheUnknown First Official Repository

Towards The Unknown is a turn-base grid-base rogue-lite. You play as an explorer who go in a giant crack looking to get ressources to bring to you village to upgrade it and upgrade you character. You fight mutated beasts, find new equipment, some are stronger, some are weaker, it's up to you to discover it. Be carreful, your inventory is limited and you can't carry everything, make you inventory as tidy as possible. Will you be brave enough to find the first explorer dead in the crack?

# A student project

This is a student project, we were working on our personnal time after courses because we didn't have courses to work on that project. <br/>
The project has been created in January 2022 and the purpose was to present the game in theCannes Festival International du Jeu (Cannes International Game Festival). So the deadline was mid-February 2023.<br/>

# Why the repository is not up-to-date?

<b>This repository will not be updated anymore</b>, I'm no longer part of the team since December, 21th of 2022. <b>I was harassed and forced to crunch</b>, I couldn't accept and stay in this team, I will work as a helper for other groups needing help.

# Our inspirations

As you may see it, it's quite inspired of the Made In Abyss anime which is a really big inspiration for our narrative designer. <br/>
The game have a Tetris inventory like Resident Evil, a combat system close to Dofus and an exploration system like the one in The Binding of Isaac.<br/>

<b>Some content couldn't be done due to time limit, our ambitions were a bit to high for how long we could work on that project.</b><br/><br/>
