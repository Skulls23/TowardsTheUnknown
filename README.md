# TowardsTheUnknown

This repository will not be updated anymore, I'm no longer part of the team. I was harassed and forced to crunch, i couldn't keep going. I will put the link to the game when it will be out in 2 months.


We were a group of 8 in full time and 1 as a helper :

<ul>
  <li>1 project manager</li>
  <li>1 scrum master</li>
  <li>2 devs</li>
  <li>2 3D artists</li>
  <li>1 level and game designer</li>
  <li>1 VFX artist</li>
  <li>1 sound designer as helper</li>
</ul>

I was the <b>Lead Dev</b> of that project for a year on that project, from the first brain-storming to the end (when we deliver the game), the deadline is 14 months, so I've been Lead Dev almost all long. <br/>

I've done :
<ul>
  <li>All the UI</li>
  <li>Inventory system</li>
  <li>Player movement scripts</li>
  <li>Player combat scripts</li>
  <li>Room changing</li>
  <li>Animation scripts</li>
  <li>Fading of players colors and weapon during the attacks animation</li>
  <li>SFX and sound scripts</li>
  <li>Many other things</li>
</ul>
